## Installation

After setting up local dev environment with PHP 7.4, you will launch this Laravel 8 app by copying the ``.env.example`` file to ``.env``

From there, create the ``bob`` database in MySQL and from the command line run the following commands:

```bash
composer install
php artisan migrate
php artisan key:generate
